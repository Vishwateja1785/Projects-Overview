# Projects-Overview
## Natural Language Processing (NLP)
### TripAdvisor: Monitoring Reviews & Responses
Developed an NLP framework using BERT to predict review sentiment and evaluate response similarity, achieving 62% accuracy in emotion prediction and 77% in response similarity metrics.

## Time-Series Forecasting
### Forecasting Walmart’s Retail Sales
Analyzed 450k+ weekly sales records with PySpark and ARIMA, incorporating factors like markdowns, holidays, and fuel prices, reducing model training time by 87%.
